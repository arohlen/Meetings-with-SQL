# Meetings-with-SQL

This is a meeting booking system with a GUI I made in 2018, not focused on design but purely on function. It uses SQL as a database to store the meetings, meeting rooms, people, and everything that is needed to book a meeting. The GUI is made in java. In the picture folder there are pictures of what the GUI looks like.
